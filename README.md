## Lab Exercises

1. **Caesar Cipher**
   - Given a line of text as plaintext, shift each character three positions to the right (modulo 26) to obtain the ciphertext.
   - Perform the reverse operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

2. **Polygram Substitution Cipher**
   - For a given plaintext, apply a polygram substitution cipher with a block size of 3.
   - Perform the reverse operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

3. **Transposition Cipher**
   - Given the plaintext:  
     `DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF RAJSHAHI BANGLADESH`
   - Encrypt using a transposition cipher with a specified width (input).
   - Perform the reverse operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

4. **Double Transposition Cipher**
   - Apply a double transposition cipher to the above plaintext.
   - Perform the reverse operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

5. **One-Time Pad Encryption**
   - Encrypt the plaintext using a one-time pad with a provided file containing a large non-repeating set of truly random key letters.
   - Perform the reverse operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

6. **Lehmann Primality Test**
   - Use the Lehmann algorithm to determine whether a given number \( P \) is prime.

7. **Rabin-Miller Primality Test**
   - Use the Rabin-Miller algorithm to determine whether a given number \( P \) is prime.

8. **MD5 Hash Function**
   - Implement the MD5 one-way hash function.

9. **Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)**
   - Implement a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) one-way hash function.

10. **RSA Encryption**
    - Encrypt a plaintext message using the RSA algorithm.
    - Perform the reverse operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

11. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**
    - Implement the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol.
